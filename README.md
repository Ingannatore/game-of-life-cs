# Game of Life

A basic console-style implementation in C#.

## Usage

Execute the console program specifying the initial world as first argument:

    GameOfLife 1,0,0|0,0,1|0,1,0

In this example, the starting world is

    1 0 0
    0 0 1
    0 1 0

If no initial world is specified, the system will randomly generate one.
